## Only relay single same port and multiple same ports.
"mode 0" is single port relay mode,can relay only 1 port;  
"mode 1" is multiple port relay mode,can realy a range of portsï¼›   
but,all of this relay only the same port between localhost and remote host.
## For single port mode
only 1 port can been relay
## For multiple port mode
many port can been relay;  
"start port" mean is minimum relay port, "end port" mean is maximum relay port,  
For example,relay port is 100 to 1000,so "start port" is 100 and "end port" is 1000.
